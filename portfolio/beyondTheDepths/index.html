          ‘Beyond the Depths’ is a piece exploring material recreation of
          natural entities that then reveal various levels of disconnect the
          further you attempt to mimic. It started with the recreation of awe in
          wide open spaces and trying to harness that space and reform it where
          there was no depth. In doing so the artist has the power to distort
          viewers perception and within that, sensory vulnerability they are
          more open to be in awe. The dual-sided screen lent use to creating
          depth, however the final external light levels hindered the final
          intended effect. Concurrently, I was researching pluralism within
          ecology and the value we place on humanity in contrast with other
          non-human life forms.

          considered the vitality of objects within an assemblage, how each has
          a part to play which contributes a proportional effect. The piece
          invites the viewer to play a part in the construction, by affecting
          the light levels that then affect both the movement of the physical
          flower structure as well as the projected illustration. By placing the
          flower on the floor, the viewer also has to bend down, physically
          alluding to a more equal plane. Flowers are a symbol of transcendence,
          drawing from

            >Aldous Huxley’s Heaven and Hell</a
          >
          where he writes of flowers and gemstones covering the entrances to
          gates to heaven. Transcendence in most cultures is a solely human
          experience, our minds elevate leaving our earthly, dirty, decaying
          bodies among all the other life forms on earth. This thought process
          denies other life forms their vitality. By using an acrylic flower
          form that moves in a life-like manner portrays a sense of vitality
          within a classic in-animate object, this in turn offers a moment of
          reflection for the viewer, interacting and responding to a non-human
          form.
